# VideoStreaming

I have created a web application for video streaming services. This application allows users to stream their favorite movies and TV shows directly from the browser.

## Installation for docker

To begin, simple environmental constants must first be set for each service. Execute the following script.

```bash
bin/start_first_docker
docker compose up
```
